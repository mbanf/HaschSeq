# Hybrid allele-specific ChIP-Seq (HaschSeq) analysis links variation in transcription factor binding to traits in maize


# Background

Variation in transcriptional regulation is a major cause of phenotypic diversity1
. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have shown that most functional variants reside in
noncoding regions, where they potentially affect transcription factor (TF) binding and
chromatin accessibility to alter gene expression. Pinpointing such regulatory variations,
however, remains challenging2. Here, we developed a hybrid allele-specific chromatin
binding sequencing (HASCh-seq) approach and identified variations in target binding of
the brassinosteroid (BR) responsive transcription factor ZmBZR1 in maize. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) in B73xMo17 F1s identified
thousands of target genes of ZmBZR1. Allele-specific ZmBZR1 binding (ASB) was
observed for about 14.3% of target genes. It correlated with over 550 loci containing
sequence variation in BZR1-binding motifs and over 340 loci with haplotype-specific DNA
methylation, linking genetic and epigenetic variations to ZmBZR1 occupancy.
Comparison with GWAS data linked hundreds of ASB loci to important yield, growth and
disease-related traits. Our study provides a robust method for analyzing genome-wide
variations of transcription factor occupancy and identified genetic and epigenetic
variations of the BR response transcription network in maize.
